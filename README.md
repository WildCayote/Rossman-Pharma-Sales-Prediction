## Business Need

Rossmann Pharmaceuticals aims to forecast sales in all stores across several cities six weeks ahead. Store managers have traditionally used experience and personal judgment for sales predictions. The finance team requires a predictive model to consider factors like promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and locality to deliver accurate sales forecasts to analysts.
